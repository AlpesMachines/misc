- synth
	. write function (set_parameter) to change synth parameters
		. move some data from synth state to patch
		. use _inc and other parameters from patch, not synth
	. distinguish between synth and drum channel (only drum has wobbly crunchines, synth has just noise ratio)
	. assembly
		. write assembly routines for common operations (saturation add for instance)
		. use assembly routines
        * add two channel output
	. add portamento/glide
	* add volume overdrive
	. add patch saving/loading
- waveforms
	* generate waveforms from bin files
	* make table of waveforms
	* make selectable waveforms
		* selector: button on akai
	. PPG waveforms?
	. DSGW waveforms?
- envelopes
	. maybe: use the same data format for envelopes (but -128)
	* make envelope selector
	* make mod-envelope selector
- midi
	* redirect current midi input to console channel
	/ change console channel on midi activity
		=> those two modes are not really compatible
- filter
	* add filter sw support
	* add conversion function filter val to expval
	* add support for pt8211
	* check division gets converted
- modulation
        . add conversion table for pitch modulation, do u16*u8 -> u24 mul
- optimization ideas:
	- change the loop: instead `for samples for chan` use `for chan for samples` so pointers are not loaded every cycle
